// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
/*Approach:
1) we use a sliding window approach, in this case
2) we use a hashmap, where we store the position of the occurences of the current character
3) we have 2 pointers slow and i which are left and right respectively
4) if c is already present that means we encounter c again and now we store the latest position of c now 
5) insert the position of the latest occurence of the character
-> map.put(c,i+1); // positions should be i+1 as we deal with indices
            maxLen=Math.max(maxLen,i-slow+1);
6) slow will be the left pointer and i would be the right pointer
    -> idea is to store the position of latest occurence of character if already present in map
    -> else store the position
